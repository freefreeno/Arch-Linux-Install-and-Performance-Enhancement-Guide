 I have Intel HD 620 that runs freeking awesome with KDE so if you would like I can tell you what I do to make it smoother than it was on 
 Gnome or Xfce for me. It shouldn't require you doing anything like what you are doing. It is easy to have max performance and NO problems
 in Arch KDE.

Go to compositor settings

set the Animation speed either all the way to the left or to the first mark

scale method crisp

OpenGL 3.1

tearing prevention auto

Keep thumbbnails - Only for shown windows

Allow applications to block compositing on



I don't think this necessary but I do it.

sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-intel.conf

Section "Device"

Identifier "Intel Graphics"

Driver "intel"

EndSection



Load guc and huc firmware ( This is a must if you want to use hardware acceleration in Chrome,Chromium or any other browser for that matter.)

sudo echo "echo \"options i915 enable_guc=2\" >> /etc/modprobe.d/i915.conf" | sudo bash

reboot

Confirm guc and huc loaded

sudo cat /sys/kernel/debug/dri/0/i915_huc_load_status

sudo cat /sys/kernel/debug/dri/0/i915_guc_load_status



You can follow any other thing you want but this is the best. I have used the Intel HD 620 since it came out on every Linux Desktop
environment and this is all you need to do.

In Arch we have a Chromium patch to enable Hardware Acceleration and with it and the these settings the you will stream video in Vp9
and H.264 and use less than half the processor than you were before with much better browsing and performance. Your Hardware acceleration 
will not work correctly without huc and guc enabled. It is one command so yea enable it.
