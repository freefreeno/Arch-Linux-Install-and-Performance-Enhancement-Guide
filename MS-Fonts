Creating a MS-font package to install with sudo pacman -U 
First off keep an up to date iso handy
Install p7zip
Run these two commands but you may need to change the name.

7z e Win10_1903_V1_English_x64.iso sources/install.wim

7z e install.wim 1/Windows/{Fonts/"*".{ttf,ttc},System32/Licenses/neutral/"*"/"*"/license.rtf} -ofonts/

The fonts willl be a folder called fonts in the same folder you were in.

Use the command to download ttf-ms-Win10 

git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/ttf-ms-win10.git

Copy All font files to the ttf-ms-win10 folder and then move to you your .build file where pacman builds packages.


You will need to use these commands to make sure you have all files copied

 cp -r *.ttf ~/Videos/ttf-ms-win10
 cp -r *.ttc ~/Videos/ttf-ms-win10
 cp -r *.rtf ~/Videos/ttf-ms-win10

Move inside the folder and run this command 
makepkg --skipchecksums

Then your packages will be in the file where your makepkg files are stored.
If you will remember during installation you changed the directory where make keeps files and you usually change to ~/.make-build in your home directory

Find the package with any on file name and open terminal in that file and run 
sudo pacman -U and the file name which will be something like this

sudo pacman -U ttf-ms-win10-10.0.18362.116-1-any.pkg.tar.xz

Make sure you keep a copy
update font cache

sudo fc-cache -f -v

Run this command and make sure it looks like this and also MAKE SURE ttf-dajavu installed first.
